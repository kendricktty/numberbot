## About This Project

Bots on Telegram, the messaging app, are typically created with Python, but other languages, such as Java, may also be used to achieve the same objective. This project is my first foray into Telegram bots, concurrently serving as an exercise on object-oriented programming with **Java** and application development with **Spring Boot**. It generates random numbers and powers of 2 from 32 (2^5) and beyond, and is an evolution from earlier iterations that used a command line interface.

## Usage

### System requirements

To sample this project, you will need the following:
